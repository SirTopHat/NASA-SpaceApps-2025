Farm From Space — GDD (Lean Gold Economy, Region-as-Location)
Turn‑based 2.5D Crops • NASA Space Apps • Gold = Budget & Score • Buyable Plots
Revision: 2025‑10‑04 — Simplified Gold-only economy, added Buy Plot, clarified Region-as-Location (run bound to chosen place).
1) Region-as-Location (Run Scope)
Select a specific place (e.g., Sibu) that belongs to a climate region (e.g., Monsoon). The run is confined to that location and reflects its region’s patterns (rain frequency, ET tendencies, NDVI cadence).
Examples:
• Monsoon: Sibu (Malaysia), Khulna (Bangladesh)
• Semi‑Arid Steppe: Dodoma (Tanzania), Jodhpur (India)
• Temperate Continental: Debrecen (Hungary), Fargo (USA)
2) High-Level Loop (20 weeks, ~5 months)
• Pick location; region traits applied.
• Start with 2 plots; choose region crops; pay planting costs from starting Gold.
• Each week: review Data Card (Rain/Soil/Stage/ET with Resolution & Cadence chips), spend Gold on any actions, resolve outcomes.
• End: auto-harvest; Final score = Harvest Gold + Unspent Gold.
3) Economy (Gold-only, No Action Points)
• Gold is both budget and score.
• Multiple actions per week allowed if affordable.
• Two simple brakes prevent spam/snowball (see §6).
Starting Gold: 60 (tuneable)
4) Actions & Costs (Simple, Teachable)
• Buy Plot: 60 → 75 → 95 → 120… (+25% each purchase this run)
• Plant Crop (per plot, once/season): Rice 18 / Maize 15 / Sorghum 12 / Wheat 14
• Irrigate (per plot): +10 mm for 5 Gold (multiple uses; see brakes)
• Apply Nitrogen (per plot): 8 Gold; at most 2× per plot per season (N‑A and N‑B)
• Scout Data (region): 3 Gold; tightens next week’s rain range; reveals a delayed stage for one plot
5) NASA Data (Player-Facing Abstractions)
• Rain (IMERG): None / Light / Heavy. Cadence ~30 min. Resolution ~10 km.
• Soil Moisture (SMAP): Dry / OK / Wet (regional baseline). Resolution ~9–36 km.
• Stage (NDVI/MODIS/VIIRS): Estab / Green‑up / Peak / Senescence. Cadence ~16‑day (updates ~every 2 weeks).
• ET (POWER): Low / Medium / High (weekly water use).
Each layer UI shows Resolution & Cadence chips to teach dataset limits.
6) Two Simple Brakes (Teach Timing, Prevent Spam)
• Diminishing Irrigation (per plot, per week): 1st = full effect; 2nd = −30%; 3rd+ = −60%.
• Wet-Risk Penalties (per plot): Soil ≥ 85% and adding water → Runoff (−3 Gold now). Soil ≥ 85% and applying N → Leaching (−5 Gold next week).
7) Under-the-Hood Numbers (Defaults)
Water: Soil_{t+1} = clamp(Soil_t + Rain + Irrigation − ET, 0..100)
• Class values: Rain None=0, Light=10, Heavy=25; ET Low=8, Med=12, High=16; Irrigate=+10.
• Soil cap: 100.
• N timing multipliers (apply to N effect): Estab 0.8×, Green‑up 1.3×, Peak 1.1×, Senescence 0.6×.
• Runoff trigger: Soil ≥ 85 when adding water → −3 Gold immediately.
• Leaching: Soil ≥ 85 when applying N → −5 Gold next week.
• Harvest: Sum weekly Growth Points; 1 GP = 1 Gold at season end.
8) Regions & Crop Pools (Bound to Location)
Monsoon (e.g., Sibu)
Crops:
• Rice
• Maize
Play tips:
• More Heavy rain weeks
• NDVI delays possible (clouds)
• Avoid N on Wet; let rain do irrigation
Semi‑Arid Steppe (e.g., Dodoma)
Crops:
• Sorghum/Millet
• Maize
Play tips:
• High ET common
• Light/None rain frequent
• Irrigate earlier; N only if not Dry
Temperate Continental (e.g., Debrecen)
Crops:
• Wheat
• Maize
Play tips:
• Reliable stages
• Minor early cold snap
• Timing > volume; hit Green‑up with N
9) Plot Purchasing (Simple Flow)
• Buy any week if you have Gold.
• Planting cutoff (e.g., Week ≤ 4): buying after cutoff risks an unplanted plot.
• Escalating cost (+25%) naturally caps expansion.
10) UI/UX (Minimal, Data-First)
• Top: Location name, Region tag, Week counter.
• Left: Data Card with layer toggles + Resolution/Cadence chips.
• Center: 2.5D board (sprites in 3D). Selected plot shows soil %, stage, icons.
• Right: Actions with costs and an ‘Expected Effect’ hint.
• Bottom: Gold balance and projected harvest.
11) NASA Alignment
• Data drives actions: Rain/Soil/Stage/ET → when to irrigate or fertilize.
• Limitations surfaced: Resolution & Cadence chips teach proper use of datasets.
• Uncertainty management: Scout gives small info boost; waiting is valid.
• Approachability: 5 actions, two brakes, small numbers.
12) Implementation Notes (2.5D Path A)
• URP 3D; camera tilt 25–35°; raycast selection.
• Tile tint by data via MaterialPropertyBlocks.
• NDVI updates every ~2 turns to reflect 16‑day composites.
• Keep shadows minimal; prioritize data color readability.
